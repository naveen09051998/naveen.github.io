### Work Experience
Internship Trainee @ BEPEC SOLUTIONS (February 2023 - Present)

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on large datasets to identify trends and patterns.
• Utilized Python and data visualization libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create informative visualizations for internal and client reports.
• Assisted in developing predictive models using supervised learning techniques.
• Conducted feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.
• Worked on a project to predict customer churn, which resulted in a 15% increase in model accuracy compared to the previous version.
• Performed data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and data imputation.
• Collaborated with the data engineering team to ensure data quality and consistency.
Graduate Research Assistant @ Texas A&M University Commerce (February 2023 - Present)
Conducted in-depth analysis of the HIKARI-2021 network dataset, which includes a comprehensive exploration of network traffic patterns and characteristics.
• Evaluated the dataset's properties, emphasizing the highly unbalanced class distribution (normal vs. attack = 93%:7%).
• Utilized state-of-the-art ML and DL algorithms, including tree-based ensemble methods and neural network architectures, to develop models for network anomaly detection.
• Implemented effective strategies to mitigate the impact of class imbalance on learning performance. This included the application of sampling techniques resulting in a substantial performance improvement, with F-measures reaching up to 99.64%.
Associate Software Engineer @ accenture(November 2020 - July 2022)
Collaborate with the development team to understand project requirements and specifications. Develop comprehensive test plans and strategies.
• Conducted efficient data mining and modeling for the Telecom department, resulting in a significant enhancement of insights.
• Specialized in telecom products such as EAD, NGEAD, SOGEA, and Dark Fiber.
• Maintained databases and optimized data extraction using stored procedures, achieving a notable reduction in query retrieval time.
• Normalized and De-Normalized databases to ensure faster query retrieval and an overall improvement in database performance.
• Develop automated tests and scripts to validate the quality, accuracy, and completeness of datasets, ensuring data integrity.
